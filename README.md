# Prototype Websites

* ***Codename [Starter_Pack](https://github.com/xSmokeAndMirrorsx/WebDevStarterPack)***: Not meant to be a very functional website. Focused on mastering basic website structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and functionality (Javascript).

   - I used Dr. Barts [my-275-scratch-site-011](https://github.com/acbart/my-275-scratch-site-011) as a kind of skeleton for this project and built from there.

# ChangeLog

* Created a basic html and css website, using Dr. Barts scratch site as a base, to demonstrate and improve upon my skill in laying out a website as well as using an effecient nomenclature method (properly using classes and IDs and such for styling and future improvement easy). 
* Added additional structure and styling using [this](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_examples.asp) tutorial as a reference.

# TODO

* Create a website that utilizes Bootstrap
* Create a website that utilizes React
* Create a website that utilizes Typescript
* Improve on "Starter_Pack" website to add additional features
