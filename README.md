# Prototype Websites

* ***Codename [Starter_Pack](https://github.com/xSmokeAndMirrorsx/WebDevStarterPack)***: Not meant to be a very functional website. Focused on mastering basic website structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and functionality (Javascript).
   
   - ****Credit To My Sources****
   - I used Dr. Barts [my-275-scratch-site-011](https://github.com/acbart/my-275-scratch-site-011) as a kind of skeleton for this project and built from there.

* ***Codename [Storebrand_Facebook](https://github.com/xSmokeAndMirrorsx/Read_It)***: Used to build my skills in Javascipt, PHP, and SQL. This site focueses on storing and organizing user input to emulate a social media site. It is very bare bones and pretty currently only has posting and liking capabiliies. 

   - ****Credit Where Credit is Due****
   - I used Andy Novocin's [heroku-play](https://github.com/AndyNovo/heroku-play) site as a starting point for this project and built from there. 

# ChangeLog

```diff
- Created a basic html and css website, using Dr. Barts scratch site as a base, to demonstrate and improve upon my skill in laying out a website as well as using an effecient
nomenclature method (properly using classes and IDs and such for styling and future improvement easy). 

- Added additional structure and styling using [this](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_examples.asp) tutorial as a reference.

# Updated the formatting and made comments visable 
```
# TODO

* Create a website that utilizes Bootstrap
* Create a website that utilizes React
* Create a website that utilizes Typescript
* Improve on "Starter_Pack" website to add additional features
* Get comments functionality on "Storebrand_Facebook"
