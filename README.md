# General Info

* The source code for each "Prototype Website" can be found by clicking the link attached to the respective website's "Codename". 

* Each website is focused on challenging and growing a specific set of skills (HTML, Typescipt, Bootstrap, CSS, React, etc.)

# Prototype Websites

* Codename Starter_Pack: Not meant to be a very functional website. Focused on mastering basic website structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and functionality (Javascript).

        -I used <blank> tutorial and got some blah blah blah

# ChangeLog

* Created a basic html and css website, to demonstrate and improve upon my skill in laying out a website as well as using an effecient nomenclature method (properly using classes and IDs and such for styling and future improvement easy).

# TODO

* Create a website that utilizes Bootstrap
* Create a website that utilizes Typescript
* Improve on "Starter_Pack" website to add additional features
