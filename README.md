# Prototype Websites

* ***Codename [Starter_Pack](https://github.com/xSmokeAndMirrorsx/WebDevStarterPack)***: Not meant to be a very functional website. Focused on mastering basic website structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and functionality (Javascript).
   
   - I used Dr. Barts [my-275-scratch-site-011](https://github.com/acbart/my-275-scratch-site-011) as a kind of skeleton for this project and built from there.
   - Added additional structure and styling using [this](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_examples.asp) tutorial as a reference.


* ***Codename [Boot_Camp](https://github.com/xSmokeAndMirrorsx/BootCamp)***: Designed to build my skills in using bootstrap effectivley and help build a scalable, compfortable user interface. 

   - I used BlondieBits [CSS in 5](https://github.com/blondiebits/code-in-5/tree/master/CSS%20in%205) as a template for my code and followed [her tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalxT0PEx8c&ab_channel=blondiebytes) to get a good starting point on my bootstrap website.
   - Followed another more in depth [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cKsq14Kfsw&ab_channel=DrewRyan) to get a better handle on bootstrap


* ***Codename [EqualAndOppositeREACTion](https://github.com/xSmokeAndMirrorsx/my-react-app)***: Built from scratch (using not template files), I was able to create a website that interacts with the user and updates the front-end using React Hooks. Designed to help refine my skills using React (mostly Hooks)

   - Followed a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I37iVCDUTU&ab_channel=PragmaticReviews) by Pragmatic Reviews to help me get react working with github pages.
   - Followed a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2UBjN5ER4s&ab_channel=BrianDesign) by Brian Design to help me figure out how hooks work and how to use them to properly update and interact with users on the front-end! This also included a little extra styling using FontAwesome.


* ***Codename [Storebrand_Facebook](https://github.com/xSmokeAndMirrorsx/Read_It)***: Used to build my skills in Javascipt, PHP, and SQL. This site focueses on storing and organizing user input to emulate a social media site. It is very bare bones and pretty currently only has posting and liking capabiliies. 

   - I used Andy Novocin's [heroku-play](https://github.com/AndyNovo/heroku-play) site as a starting point for this project and built from there. 

# ChangeLog

```diff
- Created a basic html and css website, using Dr. Barts scratch site as a base, to demonstrate and improve
